# rdas_build_test

```
git clone https://github.com/rrfsx/rdas_build_test.git
cd rdas_build_test
./build_test.sh guoqing-noaa simplify rtrr
```
The usage of build_test.sh is as follows:
`./build_test.sh github_name branch_name account_name`  

So in the above example, `guoqing-noaa` is my github account name, `simplify` is my branch name and `rtrr` is my slurm account to be used on Hera.
